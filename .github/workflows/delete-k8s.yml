# The workflow deletes all resources recorded in a terraform tfstate file.
# If run_id is passed, then download the tfstate file, which will be used to detroy the resources.
# User can also upload the tfstate file to the Terraform3 folder (it's only recommended for a private repo)
# If no tfstate file is provided, nothing will happen.
